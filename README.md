# Project 5: Snake

* Author: Brian Wu
* Class: CS121 Section #01
* Semester: Fall 2021

## Overview

This is a snake program that has a snake move around, level up, and show the GUI.

## Reflection

This was an incredibly difficult project, but with the time I had I felt like the result I made might be one of the best. I have the snake moving, scoring, leveling, and timer working. I even have the collision occurred method working! 

One problem that I ran into was the issue of trying to come up with ideas, but I kind of overcame that issue. I felt like when it came to coding it was a lot easier that thinking of it conceptually. I will take that advice into the next projects and plan things better.

## Compiling and Using

This should work as normal without any extra information needed. Just run the command and it should work.
